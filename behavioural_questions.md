# Behavioral Questions

## 1. What attracted you to our startup?

I'm particularly drawn to Growtrics because of your innovative approach to leveraging AI in education technology. Your vision aligns perfectly with my passion for using cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems, and I see tremendous opportunity to contribute to building scalable AI solutions that can genuinely impact how people learn and grow.

## 2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

In 5 years, I envision myself as a Solution Architect, leading the design of large-scale, innovative systems. I want to be the person who can translate complex business requirements into elegant technical solutions, mentor engineering teams, and drive architectural decisions that enable companies to scale efficiently. I'm particularly interested in continuing to work at the intersection of AI and scalable infrastructure, helping organizations leverage emerging technologies to create competitive advantages.

## 3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)?

Each transition in my career has been driven by a desire for greater technical challenges. At Rennlabs, the company operates like a software studio and focuses more on addressing business problems than on engineering.

## 4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why?

Technology, especially AI, can revolutionize education by personalizing learning experiences at scale. From my experience building recommendation systems using vector similarity and hierarchical data structures, I've seen how AI can understand patterns and deliver tailored content. In education, this could mean adaptive learning paths that adjust to each student's pace and learning style, intelligent tutoring systems that provide instant feedback, and automated assessment tools that free up educators to focus on higher-value interactions.

## 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

Based on my recent performance review (3.2/4) and feedback from colleagues:

**Three Strengths:**
1. **High Performance & Technical Excellence**: My employers consistently praise my ability to deliver both quality and quantity, especially in backend development. For example, I achieved 90% API response time improvements and 60% LLM cost reductions through systematic optimization approaches.

2. **Problem-Solving & Innovation**: I'm known for proactively identifying issues and building solutions. I restructured our backend architecture to enable 40% faster feature development and established comprehensive monitoring that reduced debugging time by 90%.

3. **Positive Energy & Team Collaboration**: Colleagues appreciate my enthusiasm and collaborative approach. I've successfully mentored 8+ developers and coordinated cross-functional teams of 15+ engineers, always bringing passion and innovation to the work.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Technical Communication**: I sometimes struggle to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I'm actively working on this by practicing simplified explanations and visual diagrams.

2. **English Communication**: While my technical English is strong, I sometimes find complex discussions challenging. I'm continuously improving through daily practice and technical presentations.

## 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

I would place it in front my company, and it would say: "Thuan is here, don't be afraid :D"

## 7. What do you believe is true, but can't prove?

I believe that AI-powered development tools will fundamentally change how we approach software engineering within the next 5 years, making the development process more creative and strategic rather than purely technical.
